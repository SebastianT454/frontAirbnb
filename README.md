## Overview
For this project, we recreated the Airbnb interface using React and Vite. The app features a responsive search bar, dynamic listing cards, and interactive navigation built with functional components and hooks. Vite provides a fast development experience and optimized builds, while React’s component-driven architecture ensures reusable UI elements, clean state management, and seamless user interactions.
